# Programming Languages
- Node.js for backend development to create the bot functionality in JavaScript.
- JavaScript for frontend development to handle user interactions in Discord.

# APIs
- Discord API for bot creation and interaction with the Discord platform.

# Packages and Libraries
- Discord.js (v13.1.0) for interacting with the Discord API efficiently.
- Express (v4.17.1) for handling API requests and routes in Node.js.
- MongoDB (v4.2.2) for storing user data, character information, and game progress.
- Axios (v0.21.1) for making HTTP requests to external APIs for character data.
- Dotenv (v10.0.0) for managing environment variables for security.

# Rationale for Technical Choices
- Node.js and JavaScript are widely used for Discord bot development, offering flexibility and ease of use.
- Discord.js is a powerful library specifically designed for creating Discord bots, providing comprehensive functionality.
- Express is a popular framework for building APIs in Node.js, simplifying the process of handling routes and requests.
- MongoDB is a scalable NoSQL database perfect for storing complex data structures like user profiles and character information.
- Axios is a lightweight HTTP client for making API requests, essential for fetching character data from external sources.
- Dotenv ensures sensitive information like API keys and database URIs are kept secure and separate from the codebase.

By leveraging these technologies and libraries, the discord anime game bot will be efficiently developed with robust features for users to enjoy collecting, battling, and customizing their favorite anime characters seamlessly within the Discord platform.
